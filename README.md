# Python Linked List
This is a Python implementation exercise on Linked List.

There are two files:
1. linked_list.py
This is the OOP implementation of the Linked List in Python.
There are two classes: Node and LinkedList.
The Node class represents a node item in the linked list.
The LinkedList class is the main implementation of the captioned feature.

2. main.py
This is the test program to run a test on the LinkedList class.
There are multiple steps to create, append, remove and insert into a Linked List.
